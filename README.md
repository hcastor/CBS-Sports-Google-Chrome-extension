# CBS-Sports-Google-Chrome-extension
This extension can hide or show the "percent picked" on CBS Sports weekly NFL make-picks page. Since it is not packaged, you have to turn on developer mode in Google Chrome (rather than pay Google $5 to put it on the Google extension store)

# Why?
I made this extension because I felt like the "percent picked" affected me psychologically when I was making my picks. I knew it had no value but when I wanted to pick a team that had a low "percent picked", I would second guess myself. I would also find myself right off the bat, just going down the list picking the highest "percent picked" teams.

# Results
At the time I am writing this, I have used it for 1 week. Regrettably I did pathetically that week. So maybe I just suck regardless of the influence of the "percent picked", but I will continue to be uninfluenced! It was a fun little project anyway.
