# CBS-Sports-Google-Chrome-extension
This extension can hide and show the percent picked on cbs sports weekly NFL make-picks page. It is not packaged, so to use it you have to turn developer mode on in google chrome. This is because I dont feel the need to pay google $5 dollars to put it on the extension store.

# Why?
I made this extension because I felt like the percent picked affected me psychology when I was making my picks. I knew it had not value but when I wanted to pick a team that had a low percent picked, I would second guess myself. I would also find my self right off the bat, just going down the list picking the highest percent picked teams.

# Results
At the time I am writing this I have used it for 1 week. Regretably I did pathetically that week. So maybe I just suck regardless of the influence of the percent picked, but I will continue to be uninfluenced! It was a fun little project anyway.
